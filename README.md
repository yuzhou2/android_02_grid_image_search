# Project 2 - *Name of App Here*

**Grid Image Search** is an android app that allows a user to search for images on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [Google Image Search API](https://developers.google.com/image-search/). Please note that API has been officially deprecated as of May 26, 2011.

Time spent: **18** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:
